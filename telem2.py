#This is a generic script for logging sensor data from a sensor connected to a raspberry pi.
#To run this as a background process on the CLI, type 'python3 file_write_TSM.py &'
#type 'kill -9' followed by PID number to terminate process

#The script does the following.
#1)Creates a file for the sensor data onboard the computer companion
#2)Reads the incoming Serial data and stores it in a variable
#3)Creates a mavlink packet to forward to the ardupilot flight controller.
